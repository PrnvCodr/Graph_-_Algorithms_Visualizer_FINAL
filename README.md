#  Graph Algorithms Visualizer

An interactive visual tool for visualizing fundamental graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms such as **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra**, **Kruskal**, and **Prim**. Built entirely using **HTML5 Canvas**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this project helps learners and competitive programmers understand graph algorithms in a dynamic, hands-on way.

##  Features

-  **Drag-and-drop node editor**: Create nodes and edges manually with full control over the graph.
-  **Real-time algorithm animations**: Visual step-by-step traversal and pathfinding.
-  **60 FPS rendering** with `<16ms` frame delay.
-  **Interactive state displays**: Visualize queue/stack/priority queue updates as the algorithm runs.
-  **Supports weighted and unweighted graphs**.
-  **Responsive design** optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
-  **Zero dependencies**: No frameworks, no backends — pure frontend.
